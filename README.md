# What Every Computational Physicist Should Know About Computer Architecture
### [CoDaS-HEP Summer School](http://codas-hep.org)

This talk will help set the stage by defining terms, technologies, and concepts that will 
be useful in later sessions of the school. To demystify the black-box approach to computing, 
we will start with an overview of computer architectures from a cluster down to microprocessor 
design. Topics such as vector registers and cache hierarchy will be discussed. Emerging
architectures and accelerators such as GPUs and Xeon Phis will be introduced. Performance metrics
such as FLOPs that are frequently used in the HPC community will be defined.
